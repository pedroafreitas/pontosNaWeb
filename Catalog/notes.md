# Fundations

## Part 1

* Entity/Domain/Models - represents the itens in catalog ( via c# record types)
* Repository - resposible for all itens storage related operations (in memory)
* Controller - controls the requests to the api

## Part 2

* Dependenct injection is technique a technique to properly inject our
repository instance with items controller.

* Data transfer objects are used to establish our peer contract with 
out api consumers (DTOs)

* Classes should not be dependents of other objects, but of interfaces.
